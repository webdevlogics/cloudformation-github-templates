Generate a static site with contact form using the Solid JS framework and deploy it to AWS. It will be hosted in an S3 bucket and served by CloudFront. The Contact Message will be sent by SES. I've prepared the Cloudformation template to create the AWS Infrastructure. You will update your website in your code editor, push it to GitHub where GitHub Actions will finish the deployment to AWS. Afterwards, use Porkbun for the domain name and ACM to generate an SSL certificate.
